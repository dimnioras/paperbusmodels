# Welcome to PaperBusModels

This is the new (and hopefully final) home of the *PaperBusModels* project.

This project contains paper models of past and present buses used in Athens Public Transport. You can print and assemble your own. The models come in **blank** designs that you can paint by yourself, **current Athens designs** and, in some cases, **older color designs** for buses that existed before the late 90's/early 2000's redesign. The scale used is approximately 1:86.
